						My name is Bettsie Flores and this page is be about me. My major
						is in computer information systems, and I intend to graduate in
						spring of 2019. In those three years, the classes I took were python,
						Principles of programming, computer graphics, Object-oriented
						programming. The classes I finished taking are computer repair,
						support 1, support 2, and web development. On my first year at
						Carroll, I majored in surgical technology. The unique reason why I decided
						switched my major was because of time and money. To be a surgeon it
						is another 12 years of school and a lot of money. So, I researched
						for weeks trying to find an associates degree career, I wanted a
						major where I could learn something new and a major that had job
						growth. That is how I decided to go with computer information
						systems. Now, The next few panels are based on what I enjoy in
						my life.

						I have always had a passion for motorcycles, well anything with two
						wheels. When I saw, the motorcycles classes happen on Carroll
						Community College, that is when I knew I wanted to ride a motorcycle.
						Of course, when I mentioned it to my mother, she told me I was crazy
						and hoped it was just a phase. I also mentioned it to some of my
						closest friends, and they thought I was crazy as well. It took a lot
						of convincing, but I did get my first motorcycle. I also took
						motorcycle classes at Carroll and got my license for it. Now, I have
						been riding for a year and a half. I love riding. I feel relaxed and
						happy when I get to ride. The only problem is that I do not know
						anyone who shares the same passion.

					I have always had a passion for animals. When I was younger, I had an
					orange tabby, but unfortunately it tried to escape out an open window.
					When it tried to escape, it got stuck and died. From there my mom
					owned seven rescued dogs. Though, we had to give them away because we
					were moving to Maryland. I missed having companions, so eventually I
					rescued a kitten that was thrown out by a family. When I got to keep
					him, I realized he had been abused and was in bad shape. Now, he is my
					best friend, and he has been with my for ten years. He is the cat with
					the green hat. I thought he was going to be the only companion, but
					when we moved two years ago, I crossed paths with another cat. This
					cat just showed up at our door and we were not going to keep her, but
					our neighbors wanted to give her away to the humane society. The only
					bad thing was that she was pregnant, and the humane society wanted to
					kill them. I did not want that for her, so I gave her shelter until
					she gave birth to the kittens. My plan was to give them away to
					different families; however, my whole family fell in love with the
					five kittens she had. Yes, five kittens, I was surprised because I
					expected her to have one or two. The kittens recently turned one this
					October, one week before my birthday. The best gift I could ask for.
					Of course, the whole process of having six more cats is hard, but I
					was glad to cross paths with a lady I met. The lady I met rescues cats
					and dogs along with her husband. Without her I would not have kept
					those cats. Either way, I love each and every single one of my cats.

						I love nature and being in the outdoors. It also relaxes me and
						makes me feel refreshed. Taking pictures is something that lets me
						remember that specific moment. Yes, it is better to experience a
						memory that exact moment, but I enjoy reliving those memories. I
						usually take pictures of nature and the sky. It was actually hard to
						choose what picture to use for this panel.
